                        <p>High School (2013 - 2017)</p>
                        <p> I went to this small charter high school in Oro Valley, AZ for both high school and middle school. It is somewhat famous for "improving" the quality of education in Arizona, by implementing a European model of education that focuses on rewarding academic achievement, allowing students to accelerate their learning through advanced classes and electives, and generally promoting a culture of hard work. In practice, however, the pressure causes many students to drop out and move to public schools, effectively selecting for students that either naturally excel in academic fields or thrive under pressure. The good results of the school are, in part, a result of this.</p>
                        <p>I stayed the whole time. And I took advantage of the resources given to me. Now, I have the unique distinction having top scores in 17 AP tests. Check it out:</p>

                        <p>I finished the Bachelor's degree I started at the University of Washington at Arizona State University within the next three years. While there, I moved away from environmental science, my original major, to move to Mathematics and Biophysics.</p>
                        <p>I graduated with a double major in <a href = "https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/bachelors/major/ASU00/LACMSBS/computational-mathematical-sciences?init=false&nopassive=true">Computational Mathematical Sciences</a> and <a href="https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/bachelors/major/ASU00/LABIPHBS/biophysics">Biophysics</a> with a cumulative GPA of 3.99 (though this is in part because ASU's grading policy at the time allowed for individual class grades to go to 4.33 in order to bring up the average in the case that you had classes that were below 4.00).</p>
                        <p>I also graduated from the <a href = "https://barretthonors.asu.edu/">Barrett Honors College</a> which is how I discovered the statistical computing and biophysics lab that I would eventually publish a paper with.</p>
                        <p>All in all, it was a good experience, and I owe a great deal to the mathematics department.</p>

                        <p>Master's Degree (2021 - 2022)</p>
                        <p>I started graduate school at Arizona State University as a PhD student in applied mathematics. For a while, I worked both as a full time student, a part time Graduate teaching assistant, and on finishing research papers, but after about a year, I realized that a PhD was not what I wanted to do with my career. It was at this point that I gathered up my last needed credits, wrapped up my research paper responsibilities, and planned to exit with a Master's degree. This is what allowed me to both finish early and work as a teaching assistant during my Master's degree.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, it was a positive, if difficult, experience. I am grateful to the Mathematics department administration for their help with my educational career and to my teachers, whose classes I will miss.</p>
                        <p>During my time I helped with the publication of the BNP-FRET paper series:</p>

                        <p>Starting during my undergraduate degree with my honor's thesis and finishing during my Master's degree, I worked with a statistical computing and biophysics lab. During my time in the lab, I researched and implemented methods for Bayesian inference on models of biophysical systems labelled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer">Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)</a>. The novelty was based on the application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Dirichlet_process">Bayesian Nonparametrics</a> in order to relax the need for an existing model during data analysis. Instead, the number of model states and the transitions between them could be inferred directly from the data. The research resulted in a three part series of paper on Bayesian Nonparametrics:</p>

                            <p>During my time at Arizona State University, I collaborated with a statistical computing and biophysics research group that specialized in applying Bayesian nonparametric methods to problems in biophysics. This approach was successful primarily because the systems being observed often had very little available data per experiment or had very significant sources of error that could be modeled and accounted for (such as the effects of optical equipment).</p>
                            <p>My collaboration implemented this approach for experiments that utilized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer">Förster resonance energy transfer</a> (FRET) in order to monitor the distance between two points on an individual molecule. Because we were monitoring a single molecule, photons came one at a time, and there was a relatively short timeframe before the dyes were chemically altered ("burnt out") by the lasers. Combining this with the desire to learn the underlying number of distinct spatial configurations taken by the molecule made it an ideal problem for Bayesian nonparametrics.</p>
                            <p>The resulting papers, published sometime after I finished my master's degree, were:</p>

                            <p>I have always had an artistic fascination with games, as I'm sure many people in my generation do. The rapid onset of computers, and their power turned games from clunky text-based interfaces to beautifully rendered 3D environments in less than half a century. But this innovation is not so important as the innovation that came with people's attempts to use the technology. The language of video game mechanics has blossomed in this newfound limelight, and I am not immune to the excitement that comes with seeing a completely new form of human expression gain its first legs.</p>
                            <p>While I am unfortunately fairly busy and not particularly skilled when it comes to drawing, sculpting, or audio design, I would like to try this form of art.</p>
                            <p>My earliest project was in a small game jam in 2020 where I made a small game with two other amateurs. You can find it <a href="https://nnizuki.itch.io/six-feet-gun-der">here</a> on itch.io.</p>
                            <p>I will keep prototyping and hopefully produce something satisfying in the future.</p>

                            <p>In a graduate level linear algebra class we were assigned an open ended final project, with the objective essentially being just to create a finished product and a presentation. The idea for using the linear algebra came from the very intelligent and hard-working Lauren Hardy, my classmate, and its thanks to her that the project went along mostly smoothly.</p>
                            <p>While not entirely useful and more of a rough draft, I found this project to be very fun to do. It let me try my hand at proofs with modular arithmetic, python coding using numpy, and using <a href="https://www.manim.community/">Manim</a> to create animations.</p>
